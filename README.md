# Small signal analysis

Given a small signal circuit netlist in spice format, this script generates the small signal expressions of node voltages and branch currents.
There are sub-routines to show Bode plots and to approximate the small signal expression in a given frequency as well. This helps to determine poles and zeros easily from the approximated expressions.
